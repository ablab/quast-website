-- Version history --

1.3   QUAST is now a multi-threaded tool: the most time-consuming step (alignment to
      a reference genome) is computed in parallel.

      A MacOS version of GeneMark.

      Significantly improved HTML-reports.

      More informative error messages.

      A simple logic for evaluating scaffolds.

      New metrics: duplication ration and largest alignment.

      More careful counting of misassemblies.

      Min contig threshold changed from 200 to 500.

      Fixed several bugs.


1.2   Indels and N's counting.

      More detailed statistics on misassemblies (classification in inversions,
      relocations, translocations, local misassemblies).

      More detailed statistics on partially unaligned contigs.

      Text reports now also available in LaTeX format.

      Python 2.5 now supported.

      Fixed bug in reading genes annotations in GFF and NCBI formats.

      QUAST now can be rerun on existing Nucmer alignments files.


1.1   Mismatches counting.

      Fixed bug in misassemblies counting (some inversions were omitted).

      GC content plot is logarithmically scaled.

      ORFs are not counted, GeneMark added instead (for gene finding, only on Linux).

      Nucmer aligner setting changed (from IDY% = 80 to 95,
      i.e. now all alignments are more robust).


1.0   Initial open source release!
