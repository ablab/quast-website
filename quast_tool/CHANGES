1.2 - Added indels and N's counting. Added more detailed statistics on misassemblies
      (classification in inversions, relocations, translocations, local misassemblies).
      Added more detailed statistics on partially unaligned contigs. Text reports now
      also available in LaTeX format. Python 2.5 now supported. Fixed bug in reading
      genes annotations in GFF and NCBI formats. QUAST now can be rerun on existing
      Nucmer alignments files.

1.1 - Added mismatches counting. Fixed bug in misassemblies counting
      (some inversions were omitted). GC content plot is logarithmically scaled.
      ORFs are not counted, GeneMark added instead (for gene finding, only on Linux).
      Nucmer aligner setting changed (from IDY% = 80 to 95, 
      i.e. now all alignments are more robust).

1.0 - Initial open source release!
