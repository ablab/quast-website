1.1 - Added mismatches counting. Fixed a bug in misassemblies counting
      (some inversions were omitted). GC content plot became logarithmically scaled.
      ORFs are not counted, GeneMark added instead (for gene finding).
      Nucmer aligner setting changed (from IDY% = 80 to 95, 
      i.e. now all alignments are more robust).

1.0 - Initial open source release!
