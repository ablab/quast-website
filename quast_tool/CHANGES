2.2   Added support of metagenomic assemblies. MetaGeneMark embedded for finding
      genes in such assemblies. Several references could be specified for detailed
      per each reference analysis.
     
      Option --ambiguity-usage added instead of old --allow-ambuguity. Three 
      different modes of processing ambiguous contigs now available.

      Option --label (or -l) to provide human-readable assembly names. Those names
      will be used in reports, plots and logs. For example:
         -l "SPAdes 2.5, SPAdes 2.4, IDBA-UD"
         -l SPAdes,"Assembly 2",Assembly3

      Interactive HTML reports are improved.

      Fixed bugs in misassemblies detection algorithm.

      Fixed several minor bugs.

2.1   Option --strict-NA added to control computation of NAx/NGAx metrics. 
      This option forces QUAST to break contigs by any misassembly event, 
      including local misassemblies (like in v.2.0). By default, QUAST v.2.1
      breaks contigs only by extensive misassemblies to compute NAx/NGAx 
      (like in v.1.*).

      Improvement of indels computation. QUAST now counts consecutive single nucleotide
      indels as one indel. Total length of all indels is also reported (equal to
      # indels metric evaluated with previous versions). Short (<= 5 bp) and long (>5 bp)
      indels are reported.

      Option --est-ref-size added to set estimated reference size for computing NGx 
      metrics in case a reference genome is not available.

      GAGE mode is parallelized.

      Fixed bugs in misassemblies detection algorithm.

      Fixed bugs in SNPs detection algorithm.

      Fixed bugs in processing circular chromosomes (affects Genome fraction, # genes,
      # operons).

      Fixed several minor bugs.

2.0   Significantly improved assessment of large genomes. Current limit on size of a
      reference genome is 536 Mbp PER CHROMOSOME instead of 536 Mbp TOTAL in the
      previous versions. Alignment to different chromosomes is performed in parallel.

      Changes in algorithm for evaluating Genome fraction, # genes and operons.
      Filtration of short, ambiguous, and redundant alignments is performed before
      the evaluation. Option --use-all-alignments is added for compatibility
      with 1.* versions.

      New algorithm for finding SNPs and indels.

      Ability to change colors, line styles, etc. in plots and content, metric names
      in reports.

      GlimmerHMM for predicting genes in eukaryotes.

      Gene Finding is parallelized and its run is controlled by --gene-finding option.

      Improvement of HTML-reports and plotting units.

      Fixed several bugs.

1.3   QUAST is now a multi-threaded tool: the most time-consuming step (alignment to
      a reference genome) is computed in parallel.

      A MacOS version of GeneMark.

      Significantly improved HTML-reports.

      More informative error messages.

      A simple logic for evaluating scaffolds.

      New metrics: duplication ration and largest alignment.

      More careful counting of misassemblies.

      Min contig threshold changed from 200 to 500.

      Fixed several bugs.


1.2   Indels and N's counting.

      More detailed statistics on misassemblies (classification in inversions,
      relocations, translocations, local misassemblies).

      More detailed statistics on partially unaligned contigs.

      Text reports now also available in LaTeX format.

      Python 2.5 now supported.

      Fixed bug in reading genes annotations in GFF and NCBI formats.

      QUAST now can be rerun on existing Nucmer alignments files.


1.1   Mismatches counting.

      Fixed bug in misassemblies counting (some inversions were omitted).

      GC content plot is logarithmically scaled.

      ORFs are not counted, GeneMark added instead (for gene finding, only on Linux).

      Nucmer aligner setting changed (from IDY% = 80 to 95,
      i.e. now all alignments are more robust).


1.0   Initial open source release!
