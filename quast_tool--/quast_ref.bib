  abstract =     {Limitations of genome sequencing techniques have lead to dozens
                  of assembly algorithms, none of which is perfect. A number of 
                  methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none 
                  is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods 
                  for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies 
                  of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of 
                  previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. 
                  Here we present QUAST --- a QUality ASsessment Tool --- to evaluate
                  and compare genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading 
                  assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. 
                  QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome as well 
                  as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables, 
                  and plots, to help scientists in their research and in their 
                  publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several 
                  genome assemblers on three data sets. QUAST tables and plots for
                  all of them are available in the Supplementary Material and 
                  interactive versions of these reports are on the QUAST website.}
