## Contact

Feel free to contact us if you have questions or want to report a bug or suggest a new feature. The most recommended way is to create an [issue](https://github.com/ablab/quast/issues) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/ablab/quast/discussions) at our GitHub repository. In this case, the whole QUAST user community can react or see an answer afterward. Alternatively, you may reach us privately via <quast.support@cab.spbu.ru> or direct message our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/quast_bioinf).

Before writing to us, please check the [Help](help.md) page, the [FAQ section](http://cab.cc.spbu.ru/quast/manual.html#sec7) of the manual, and [existing issues](https://github.com/ablab/quast/issues?q=is%3Aissue) at GitHub. Thank you!
