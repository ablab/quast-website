## Download

QUAST is an open-source project, you can browse, download or contribute to the source code of both the [webserver](https://github.com/ablab/quast-website/) and its [command-line engine](https://github.com/ablab/quast/) at GitHub.

For installing the command-line version of QUAST (works on Linux and macOS), we recommend using common package managers:

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/): `conda install -c bioconda quast`  
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) ([Brewsci/bio](https://github.com/brewsci/homebrew-bio)): `brew install quast`  
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/): `pip install quast`  

You may also download the latest and older QUAST releases from SourceForge ([latest](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quast/files/latest/download), [all versions](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quast/files/)) or GitHub ([latest](https://github.com/ablab/quast/releases/latest), [all versions](https://github.com/ablab/quast/releases)). Installation is pretty straightforward and [described in the manual](http://cab.cc.spbu.ru/quast/manual.html#sec1). 

We distribute relatively stable but not thoroughly tested *pre-release* versions at GitHub only (check out the latest one [here](https://github.com/ablab/quast/releases)). With caution, you may also clone and use the cutting-edge developers' version from GitHub:  
`git clone git@github.com:ablab/quast.git`
